# Job Tracker (MERN Stack Project)

This is my first project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  
The goal of this project is to track job applications, allowing users to manage the jobs they've applied for in an organized way.

ðŸš§ **Note:** This project is still under development.
