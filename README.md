# Job Tracker (MERN Stack Project)

This is my first project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  
The goal of this project is to track job applications, allowing users to manage the jobs they've applied for in an organized way.

ðŸš§ **Note:** This project is still under development.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asemzaidan2003/job_tracker.git

### 2. Setup the Backend
use terminal to go to : cd ./backend
then Create a .env file and add the following line
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/job_tracker
```
You can use your own MongoDB Cloud URI if you prefer

Install dependencies

npm install
```

```

### 3.Setup the Frontend
Open a new terminal, then

### 4.Adding data to the database
You can use postman to do this by adding a post req to this path

```bash
http://localhost:3000/api/company
```
then add this req body:
```bash
{
  "company_name": "TechNova Solutions",
  "company_email": "info@technova.io",
  "company_phone_number": "+962798765432",
  "company_address": "King Abdullah II Street, Amman, Jordan",
  "company_linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/company/technova",
  "company_website": "https://www.technova.io",

  "company_hr_email": "omar.khatib@technova.io",
